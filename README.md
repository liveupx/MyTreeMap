## 🔧 Technical Implementation

The MyTreeMap application integrates several advanced technologies:

### Claude AI Integration
The TreeIdentifier component demonstrates Claude integration by:
- Simulating an AI-powered tree species identification feature
- Processing uploaded images and returning structured tree data
- Providing confidence scores and environmental benefits information

### Supabase Integration
The project uses Supabase for data storage and user contributions:
- The `supabase-client.ts` file initializes the Supabase client with demo credentials
- Community contributions are stored and retrieved from Supabase tables
- File storage is simulated for tree images
- Fallback to mock data when in demo mode ensures the UI remains functional

### Sentry Integration
Error tracking and monitoring with Sentry:
- Initialized in `main.tsx` with proper DSN configuration
- React Router instrumentation configured in `App.tsx` for route-based error tracking
- Error boundaries wrap the application to provide graceful failure handling
- Custom error capture for API failures with proper context

### ElevenLabs Integration
Audio narration capabilities:
- The AudioGuide component uses ElevenLabs for text-to-speech narration
- Uses ElevenLabs voices for natural-sounding city tour guides
- Provides fallback audio content for demo mode

### Lovable Implementation
The entire application is built using Lovable:
- React and TypeScript for robust frontend development
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- shadcn/ui components for consistent UI patterns
- Modular component architecture for maintainability
- Responsive design principles throughout the application

This architecture ensures the application demonstrates all required integrations while maintaining a clean, maintainable codebase that gracefully handles both online and offline/demo scenarios.
